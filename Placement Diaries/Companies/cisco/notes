How does a CPU handle sorting with a limited RAM and a hard disk that can have larger amount of data?

    - Divide data into chunks 
    - sort them individually using merge sort and then dump them to a hard disk 
    - merge them back together using merge k sorted arrays
    - Code : external_sorting.cpp
